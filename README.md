## Description üìù
During this course I created a web app from scratch, so without any frameworks, using HTML, CSS and Javascript. The goal is to make a web app from scratch where
i can find an overview of the top 20 cryptocurrencies. The cryptocurrencies will have a detail page where more information about the specific coin is given. 

I choose this idea because i like crypto and the idea behind blockchain. The data I use comes from the [Binance Spot Api](https://github.com/binance/binance-spot-api-docs/blob/master/rest-api.md).
The Binance API is created by the Binance exchange. Everything which can be done manually on their web app related to spot trading can be done with the API as well.

Examples:

- fetchTicker
- fetchCurrencies
- fetchBalance
- createOrder
- cancelOrder
- fetchOrder
- fetchOrders
- fetchOpenOrders
- fetchClosedOrders
- deposit
- withdraw
